# pyChirpZ

Implementation of the chirp-z transform in python. Can be used to
evaluate creatively on the unit disk, or to zoom the FFT. Two
implementations, one in numba and one in C++ with eigen that is
stand-alone enough to be used in other C++ projects.

## Example

You have a function defined with finite support and you wish to
evaluate the the DFT on it.
